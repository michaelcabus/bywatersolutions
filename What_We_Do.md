<h3>Customized Koha Installations and Implementations:</h3>

To ensure the safety and security of your database, ByWater Solutions offers a complete hosted environment on ByWater equipment placed in the virtual networking cloud. This also delivers improved performance for both your staff and your users. An example of a Koha system hosted in the ByWater cloud can be found on our <a title="ByWater Solutions Demos" href="/demos/">Demos page</a>. Other functions include the maintenance of your Linux server, the management of databases with real-time backups, and the installation of updates and upgrades to both the Linux server and your Koha ILS software. We also have options for installing Koha on local servers at your library. With the correct remote access we could completely manage the installation at your library.

<h3>Data Migration and Data Manipulation:</h3>

Skilled manipulation of library data is the key to a successful migration. Because it is the most important representation of a library's collection, we take the time to proficiently manage your data. Before we move your data into any new system we check each record for accuracy, identifying and manipulating each record for the correct encoding and diacritical display. We work closely with each library to ensure there are no duplicate entries and to consistently use the highest quality records for complete accuracy of bibliographic detail. In addition, each of our new customers receives a test system during the migration process to practice with and to be trained on.

<h3>Expert Anytime Koha Support:</h3>

Quality of support is the most important focus of our company and we pride ourselves on the implementation of this key feature. ByWater Solutions has the lowest customer to support personnel ratio in the business, and we are hiring additional support specialists regularly. If you are having an issue with your system, our support team will help to solve the problem. Our top rated 24/7 support package is completely comprehensive and ensures the best possible Koha experience for our customers. We also ensure all of our customers have the tools to be plugged into the wealth of knowledge and expertise available within the Koha community.

<h3>Koha Hosting Services (Servers Located in the US and Canada):</h3>

ByWater Solutions plans and prepares for the worst by taking the following precautions and installing the following safeguards to protect your data. We perform a daily backup of all system data stored on the cloud. This information is saved both on-site and off-site, and is comprised of the all of the system data, and all other information found on the main server. In addition to the daily backups listed above, we create a mirrored image of the system data and code-base on our servers located at the ByWater main office in California (US based customers only).  If you so choose, we can also set up an additional system backup onsite at your library's location and populate that daily for an additional fee.

<h3>Comprehensive Koha Training:</h3>

Our company is dedicated to the expert training and implementation of Koha. All ByWater Solutions training sessions are led by professional MLS librarians and accomplished Koha trainers. We provide multiple formats for different learning styles including on-site, hands-on, classroom style learning, on-line presentations and demonstrations, and internally produced training manuals. ByWater Solutions' Educators are also the Documentation contributors for the worldwide Koha Community.

<h3>Custom Koha Development:</h3>

ByWater Solutions fully embraces the ideals and practices of open source software. Because of this all custom development sponsored by our customers and completed by our company will be publicly available at all times, even while still in progress, in the [ByWater Git repository](https://github.com/bywatersolutions "GitHub"). After the code has been tested and released to our customer for production use, we then publish the code to the community either in the form of a patch (for smaller code changes) or a pull request from our Git Repo. After all, sharing is caring!
