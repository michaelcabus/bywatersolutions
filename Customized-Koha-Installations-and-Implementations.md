To ensure the safety and security of your database, ByWater Solutions offers a complete hosted environment on ByWater equipment placed in the virtual networking cloud. This also delivers improved performance for both your staff and your users. An example of a Koha system hosted in the ByWater cloud can be found on our <a title="ByWater Solutions Demos" href="/demos/">Demos page</a>. Other functions include the maintenance of your Linux server, the management of databases with real-time backups, and the installation of updates and upgrades to both the Linux server and your Koha ILS software. We also have options for installing Koha on local servers at your library. With the correct remote access we could completely manage the installation at your library.
