![Migration Team]({{site.baseurl}}/https://github.com/michaelcabus/bywatersolutions/blob/master/img/Migrationteam.JPG?raw=true)Skilled manipulation of library data is the key to a successful Koha migration. Because it is the most important representation of a library's collection, we take the time to proficiently manage your data. Before we move your data into your new Koha system we check each record for accuracy, identifying and manipulating each record for the correct encoding and diacritical display. We work closely with each library to ensure there are no duplicate entries and to consistently use the highest quality records for complete accuracy of bibliographic detail. In addition, each of our new customers receives a test system during the migration process to practice with and to be trained on.

Our Koha migration and server setup services include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
 	<li>Creation of a test Koha system for training and testing</li>
 	<li>Transfer of all data from legacy ILS to Koha</li>
